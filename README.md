&nbsp;\*\*Half Adder\*\* â€“ Schematic to GDSII

&nbsp;

This repository showcases the complete custom digital design flow of a Half Adder, from schematic capture to final GDSII layout. The design is implemented using standard cells or transistor-level design techniques, with optimization for area and performance.



\*\*ðŸ§© Key Highlights:\*\*



* Custom schematic design of a Half Adder
* Symbol creation and hierarchy management
* Layout design with DRC and LVS verification
* Parasitic extraction (PEX) to analyze layout-induced effects
* Post-layout simulation to validate performance under realistic conditions
* Final GDSII file ready for tape-out or further integration



\*\*ðŸ’¡ Design Specs:\*\*



* Technology node: (specify if used, e.g., 45nm, 180nm)
* Compact and optimized transistor sizing
* DRC \& LVS clean using Cadence tools or equivalent
* Includes performance insights due to parasitic components



\*\*ðŸš€ Purpose:\*\*



* Educational demonstration of the full custom VLSI flow
* Serves as a reference for learning schematic vs layout comparison
* Foundational IP block for arithmetic logic units (ALUs)
