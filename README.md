 **Half Adder** – Schematic to GDSII
 
This repository showcases the complete custom digital design flow of a Half Adder, from schematic capture to final GDSII layout. The design is implemented using standard cells or transistor-level design techniques, with optimization for area and performance.

**🧩 Key Highlights:**

⦁	Custom schematic design of a Half Adder
⦁	Symbol creation and hierarchy management
⦁	Layout design with DRC and LVS verification
⦁	Parasitic extraction (PEX) to analyze layout-induced effects
⦁	Post-layout simulation to validate performance under realistic conditions
⦁	Final GDSII file ready for tape-out or further integration

**💡 Design Specs:**

⦁	Technology node: (specify if used, e.g., 45nm, 180nm)
⦁	Compact and optimized transistor sizing
⦁	DRC & LVS clean using Cadence tools or equivalent
⦁	Includes performance insights due to parasitic components

**🚀 Purpose:**

⦁	Educational demonstration of the full custom VLSI flow
⦁	Serves as a reference for learning schematic vs layout comparison
⦁	Foundational IP block for arithmetic logic units (ALUs)
